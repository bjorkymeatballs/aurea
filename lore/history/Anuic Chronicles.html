The Riparians would come from the south, from the green seas to <span class="small-caps annotation-link" onclick="toggle10()">Upper Fayyam</span>. The Deltans ventured into <span class="small-caps annotation-link" onclick="toggle11()">Lower Fayyam</span>, in great numbers, from the white seas. The two spread up and down the breadth of these lands, and found themselves in conflict. "Let us divide these lands, so that we may live in peace and our crops grow," the Deltans said. "You shall dwell in lower Fayyam, as we shall live upstream," replied the Riparians. "Where the Anu spreads and splays our boundary shall lie," they agreed and so it was done. Northward of <span class="small-caps annotation-link" onclick="toggle12()">the Fork</span> the Riparians were meant to lie and south of it the Deltans. This peace has been kept true.</p>

They were subdued but they claimed the seas and settled in our lands, where they have resided since in peace. The Khemes brought themselves to our lands after their subjugation, to learn of our ways and speak our tongues. <span class="small-caps annotation-link" onclick="toggle13()">Great struggle</span> had left them malleable and wanting for guidance, and so we have indulged in these desires. They have taken up residencies in our cities, so that they may become citizens and worship our gods.</p>

            <p>Anuics are one of the three native peoples of Fayyam. They are half-elves; the result of centuries of interbreeding between the men and elves of the region. Anuics now constitute the majority people of Fayyam, although they are mostly clustered in the Delta and cities of the Kingdom. For further reading click here: <a href="#">Anuics</a>.</p>

            <p>The Hlitish are men from the faraway lands of Hrithgar. They introduced themselves into the region during the Hlitish Raids of [AGE]. Over the next two centuries a large amount of Hlitish would settle in the Delta. Initially isolated and independent, they would begin to intergrate with the surrounding peoples. They would found and grow various coastal deltan settlements. For further reading click here: <a href="#">Hlitish</a>.</p>
